# File-Cleaner
A program in python that can be used as a file cleaner application to organise files in folders in a very convenient manner.

Used the OS module to make folders and sort the files into the folders. 
The OS module lists the contents of the directory and then it sorts the files by using their extension. 
After sorting it puts the files in its respective folders.

In order to run the program, simply move the code.py file to the directory under consideration and execute the code.py file in that directory. The files in that folder will be 
seperately moved to different folders so as to give the directory a more organized and clean look.
